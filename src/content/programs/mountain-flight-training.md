title: "Mountain Flight Training"
description: "A 3-day Sierra Nevada mountain-flying course based in Reno. Master density altitude planning, mountain weather, terrain awareness, and high-elevation operations with instructor-guided routes to local mountain airports."
imagePath: "/src/assets/plane_flying_montain.webp"
imageAlt: "Training aircraft flying above the Sierra Nevada near Lake Tahoe"
part: "Part 61"
syllabus: "NV Flight Mountain Checkout"
highlights:
  - "Density altitude (DA) performance planning and takeoff/landing technique"
  - "Mountain weather: winds aloft, mountain waves, rotors, lenticulars, convective activity"
  - "Terrain/obstacle awareness, route selection, and emergency options"
  - "High-altitude airport operations and stabilized approach profiles"
  - "Short/soft-field technique refinement and go-around discipline"
  - "Risk management (PAVE/5P), personal minimums, and go/no-go frameworks"
outcomes:
  - "Plan and execute safe mountain routes within clearly defined personal minimums"
  - "Apply performance charts for high-elevation, high-DA departures and arrivals"
  - "Interpret mountain weather hazards and choose conservative routing"
  - "Use stabilized approaches and energy management at terrain-confined airports"
  - "Eligible for mountain checkout sign-off at instructor discretion upon satisfactory completion"
prerequisites:
  - "Private Pilot ASEL (Instrument rating recommended)"
  - "FAA medical (3rd Class or BasicMed equivalent)"
  - "Recent PIC experience and familiarity with short/soft-field operations"
idealFor:
  - "Pilots new to Sierra Nevada/Western U.S. mountain operations"
  - "Renters seeking NV Flight mountain checkout"
  - "Pilots planning trips to Truckee, South Lake Tahoe, or Mammoth"

## Course Snapshot
- **Duration:** 3 days
- **Training:** 15 hours dual instruction · 5 hours ground instruction
- **Investment:** **$4,500.00**
- **Typical Training Airports:** TRK (Truckee), TVL (South Lake Tahoe), MMH (Mammoth Yosemite),  **weather dependent** *

***Note:** Actual routing depends on winds, weather, airspace/TFRs, airport NOTAMs, runway conditions, and instructor discretion.

## Airports & Routes
- **TRK – Truckee Tahoe (KTRK):** Terrain-confined pattern, density altitude, winds over ridgelines.
- **TVL – South Lake Tahoe (KTVL):** High-elevation operations, pattern management near terrain and lake effects.
- **MMH – Mammoth Yosemite (KMMH):** High field elevation, mountain wave/rotor awareness, performance margins.

## What You’ll Learn (3-Day Outline)

### Day 1 – Ground Foundations & Local Mountain Ops
- Ground: mountain weather, winds aloft, waves/rotors/lenticulars, DA performance, conservative route planning, emergencies.
- Flight: local terrain orientation; short/soft-field refresh; performance testing; approach stabilization and go-around discipline.

### Day 2 – Truckee & Tahoe
- Ground: cross-country planning and alternates; terrain corridor selection; briefing NOTAMs/TAFs/Winds Aloft.
- Flight: **TRK** and **TVL** (as conditions permit); terrain-confined patterns; stabilized approaches; missed/escape routes.

### Day 3 – Mammoth & Scenario Work
- Ground: risk management (PAVE/5P), personal minimums, oxygen/physiology awareness (advisory), debrief of contingency plans.
- Flight: **MMH** (as conditions permit); route and altitude selection; energy management; diversion drills; full debrief and plan to maintain proficiency.

## Bring & Be Ready
- Current gov’t photo ID, pilot & medical certificates, logbook
- Headset, kneeboard/EFB with current charts, performance data
- Personal minimums template (We’ll help you refine it.)
- Season-appropriate clothing and hydration

## Policies & Safety Notes
- **Mountain checkout:** NV Flight rental policy requires a mountain-flying checkout with an NV Flight instructor before renting for mountain flights. This course prepares you for that sign-off; issuance is at instructor discretion.
- **Performance/DA limits:** We brief and operate within NV Flight rental limits and airport/aircraft performance requirements; departures are never conducted outside published or company limits.
- **Weather first:** All cross-country segments are **weather-permitting**; alternates or local scenarios may be substituted to meet learning objectives.
